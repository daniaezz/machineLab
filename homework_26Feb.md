# ðŸŽ¢ Roller Coaster - Updates
### Team Members: Dania, Sunny, Swostik

## Monday 
### Progress
- We **SUCCESSFULLY** 3D printed our tracks ðŸŽ‰. We also laser cut wheels so that they perfectly fit the track and the motor.
We now have a rack and pinion model for our roller coaster. We laid the track with copper stripes and stranded wires
to carry electricity to the car. And we created grooves in the track to help with the friction issue that would occur when trying
to move the car up a slope. It was a lot of trial and error but it works!! 

### Challenges 
- We attempted to 3D print more tracks, but faced repeated failures with the printer. We need to find an alternative 3D printer to use moving forward.  
- We faced some issues with the motors. We thought the motors we used were geared DC motors, but turns out they probably arenâ€™t. The motors we are currently using do not have enough torque and they spin uncontrollably fast. 

### Next Steps & Questions
- We are thinking of using the sparkfun kit motors (yellow ones) since those seemed to work, but we do not have an axle that we can use to connect those motors to the wheels, so we need help with that
- We need to find alternative 3D printers
- We could to add a little groove to the tracks for the metallic strip that will carry the electricity to the motors once we know what strip we will use for the final

## Wednesday
### Progress
- We changed the motors on our car to the geared motors. We had to design a different wheel and laser cut it to fit on the new motors. Our car now runs on the tracks!

### Challenges
- 3D printer not working well
- The motors are not securely placed on the car and they keep sliding off
- The car goes off track, we need to print the car support  

### Next steps
- We need to find a way to secure the motors well, as the previous placement does not work well for this current design.
- We need to continue 3D printing the tracks as well as other parts of our car
