## Topics I like !

### 4 years at NYUAD

I really liked aigrem’s idea of creating the storyline of 4 years at NYUAD. I feel like its a very relatable topic to most people that I'll be at the IM showcase to view the clock and it's a sweet idea to have it just in time for commencement so that those that are graduating can see their journey through time, literally and metaphorically, at NYUAD. This topic fits perfectly with the end of the academic year and I feel like it would be an interesting topic to explore. 

### Rollercoaster/Amusment park

I really liked Juanma’s idea of a roller coaster/amusement park and I feel like the mechanisms used in this would be applicable to understanding how a lot of machines in real life actually work and it would also be a clock like never before! It looks like a very fun idea that can also involve some user interaction, which I believe is a function many clocks don't possess. I am imagining this clock will be broken down into the different games and rides seen at an amusement park such as the ferris wheel, bumper cars, moving targets and merry go round.  



## 4 Projects under the theme: NYU Abu Dhabi 4 year cycle (brainstorming with Swostik)

1. Candidate Weekend
2. Marhaba
3. Study Away
4. Commencement

## Developing the Project: Commencement

### What would it depict?

This project is the last part in the theme of the NYUAD 4 Year cycle - The Commencement. It celebrates the graduation of the students from the class year.

### What materials will you use for each part?

- Motors, rubber, , etc for a continuous hidden conveyer belt
- Laser cut 2d figures as the other students
- 1 3d printed figure of the primary student wearing the graduation attire.
- Transparent strings to suspend the figures

### How would you animate anything moving?

- The conveyer belt would be moving continuously. This would allow the movement of the person through the stage and exit.
- We envision suspending the hats of the figures from the ceiling using transparent strings. In the end as the character exits, all the caps go up giving an illusion of them being thrown high up in the air.

### Will there be sound? What?

- The sound of the name of the person being called in pitch silnce as they start walking up the stage.
- The sound of the crowd cheering as the person walks across the stage.
- Super upbeat music starts playing combined with cheering and the sound of caps flying across the room.
- The music fades out as the person exits the stage.

### Will there be lights? (We have lots of NeoPixels.)

- Commencement generally happens in a super well lit room in colors of white and the classic NYU purple. We can use the neopixels to mimic the same.
- Might try for a high intensity beam of light on the person as they walk across the stage.

### Make a rough sketch, to the best of your ability.

### What mechanical/electronic components will you need?

- Servo motors
- DC motors
- Rubber belts
- Gears
- Pulleys
- Speakers
- LED's
- Thin Metal rods/plates

### Draw a block diagram showing very roughly how these components are connected. You don't need to show the circuit or specific wires, just in general what is connected to what.
